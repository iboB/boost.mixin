## Overview
Boost.Mixin is an entity-component system. It is non-intrusive, which means
you can (relatively) easily include it in an existing project or even
extend existing projects without modifying their source. Apart from the
entity-component model Boost.Mixin provides messages as opposed to
interfaces, thus making its components mixins.

For a lenghty introduction, which describes what an entity-component system
is in more detail and expalins its usefulness see **Introduction**
