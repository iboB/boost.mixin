[section:roadmap Roadmap]

Here is a list of planned features and events for the library: (The authors
write it in their own free time, so concrete dates are hard to estimate)

* Hopefully by April 2014:
    * Full documentation
    * Formal submission to Boost
* Not soon, but with concrete idea of how to be done:
    * Case-study: A demo project, that better illustrates the libraries
    functionalities in a "real life" scenario. Complete with a document which
    gives problems for motivation and their Boost.Mixin solutions.
    * Message bids -- allow mixins to "bid" for different messages (analogous to
    `priority` for unicasts, but hides implementations on multicast messages)
    * object copy-constructors + mixin feature `copyable`
    * private messages/mixins -- messages/mixins that are not used outside of a
    module - leave more room for other messages/mixins
    * Add a new mixin feature `fact`. Facts are static const variables in a
    mixin. No multicasts. No virtual tables.
    * Add possibility for custom default message implementations
    (instead of a runtime error if no message is provided)
    * Call mixin constructors when mutating object or constructing them via
    object type templates. Sample usage:
    `mutate(obj).add<mixin>("foo", param2).add<other_mixin>(42)`
    * Reflection. Create objects with mixins by string. Call messages by string.
    * "Static" mixins. As long as they're not mutated in or out, it provides a
    faster message execution.
    * Integration with Boost.Serialization. As long as the mixins of an object
    are serializable, the object will be, too.
    * Make use of the fact that a BIG execution time improvement can be made if
    a user has no mixins or messages defined in a dynamic library (and has no
    plans to add such)
    * Reduce library memory footprint
    * Vectorized mixin/message memory: Instead of having a maximal number of
    them, grow the mixin_type_info/message_info buffers by that
    number. Might lead to slower mutations.
    * Unused type garbage collector. When no objects exist of a given type it
    can be garbage collected, saving up to a kilobyte of memory.
    * Create a preprocessing tool (like Qt's moc) that can be used instead of
    the macros for mixin and message definition.
* When humankind becomes a Kardashev type two civilization:
    * Integration with Boost.Thread. Call messages for a specific thread.
    * User-defined message hooks. Sample implementation with messages called on
    objects on another device through Boost.Asio.
    * A way to mutate static mixins in and out. Slight mutation execution penalty.
    * Some magic to make it work even faster.
    * Integration with Boost.Python and luabind.
    * Remove C++03 backward compatibility.
    * Library being accepted in Boost?
	* Mixin/Message domains - sets of mixins and messages that cannot be mixed.
	Will throw a runtime error when trying to combine certain mixins or messages.
