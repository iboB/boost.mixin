Boost.Mixin
===========

A C++ implementation of the mixin concept.
The ultimate goal is for it to be submitted to (and hopefully one
day accepted in) the Boost C++ libraries.

## Disclaimer

This library is *not* an official part of [the Boost libraries collection](http://www.boost.org).
It will be submitted for review somewhere in late 2013.

## Documentation

The (still incomplete) documentation is available at
[the github page of the library](http://ibob.github.com/boost.mixin/).

For questions and comments you can contact the developers at the [Boost developers' malining list](http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost).
