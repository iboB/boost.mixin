Boost.Mixin
===========

An optimized entity-component system with many features still in its early stages 
of development. The ultimate goal is for it to be submitted to (and hopefully one
day accepted in) the Boost C++ libraries.

## Documentation

The (still incomplete) documentation is available at
[the github page of the library](http://ibob.github.com/boost.mixin/).
