[section:what_is_an_ecs What is an entity-component-system?]

An entity-component-system (ECS) allows users to create entities which consist
of components. A simplified way of thinking about that is a container of
instances of unique types. Another way of thinking about said entities is like
they are objects produced from multiple inheritance only they are constructed in
runtime, as opposed to compile-time.

Here's a piece of code that might be used in a simple hypothetical ECS:

    entity e;
    e.add_component(new xml_serializer);
    e.add_component(new book_data);
    // now the entity contains data and a way to serialize this data
    // ...
    // here we can test if an entity has the components we need
    if(e.has_component<xml_serializer>())
    {
        e.get_component<xml_serializer>()->serialize();
    }

See how we can think of `e` as a container of various objects, or as a class
derived from both `serializer` and `data`. However it is not exactly a container
as it cannot have two instances of the same class, and it is not exactly a class
with multiple inheritance as its contents cannot be statically analyzed.

[section:whats_good_in_ecs Why are entity-component-systems good?]

They allow the users to achieve true decoupling of their subsystems. For example
if we extend the above example to have a registered component of type
`serializer`, which is a pure virtual class with a method `virtual void
serialize() = 0`, the code example from above would still work, but we would be
able to change the last part to something a bit more useful:

    if(e.has_component<serializer>())
    {
        e.get_component<serializer>()->serialize();
    }

Now all functions that want to call `serialize` for an object may as well be
oblivious to what the /actual/ serializer within the entity. Keep in mind that
this is nearly impossible to achieve with plain multiple inheritance as users
would have to handle the combinatorial explosion of different `serializer`'s,
`data`'s and other possible super-classes.

The above example shows that an ECS is, in most cases, a better choice than
multiple inheritance. But what about composition?

Well, an ECS is a type of composition, with one difference. An entity has no
idea what kind of components may be a part of it.

Imagine a the straight-forward way to composition. An object from our system
will have methods like `get_serializer()`, `get_data()`, and more. This means
that every time we add a new sub-system, we'll have to change the object type
to "enrich" it with its new components. Removing the aforementioned limitation
allows independent sub-system development -- without changing the code of the
original product. I also allows the introduction of entire subsystems with
dynamic libraries, which don't change the binary. For example, writing an
entirely new serialization mechanism -- say encrypted serialization -- for a
product and introducing it as an optional plug-in becomes a breeze.

[section:nonpoly_ecs Non-polymorphic entity-component-systems]

There exists a technique, often also called entity-component-system, that is not
polymorphic. It can be combined to a degree with code like the one described
above but it requires special maintenance.

Essentially what it does is, the entity has pointers (or sometime indexes) of
concrete components, that aren't managed by it, but by the subsystems that use
these components. The subsystems contain dense arrays of these components, which
they process, often being oblivious of entities and other higher-level concepts.

This is done in very performance heavy pieces of software, where even the
cache locality of the data is critical. Since polymorphism is incompatible with
cache locality, those systems sacrifice (at least to some degree) the ease of
use and maintainability for the speed.

This is especially popular in high-end games, where in order to produce state
of the art graphics and physics with a decent framerate, each microsecond is of
importance.

[endsect]

[section:who_uses_ecs Who uses entity-component-systems?]

They are very popular in game development, as most objects in a game have many
different aspects for different sub-systems. Still, being as powerful as they
are, they find their place in many other pieces of software developed in C++,
Java or C#.

It is the author's opinion that any big project with complex objects could
benefit from using an ECS. Indeed games and game engines are a prime example of
such a project, but there are many others. Any software that has optional
dynamic library plug-ins, most CAD systems, graph editors, project management
tools, and many others.

Most script-language objects natively support a functionality resembling the
polymorphic form of these systems, and most of them call it /Mixins/.

[section:app_vs_watch Appendix B. Visual Studio watch visualizers]

If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio, you can install special watch
visualizers which will make adding `boost::mixin::object` in a watch window a
better experience.

There are two ways to do this, which will work on both the full and express
versions of Visual Studio.

[section:natvis Modern: .natvis files. VS 2012 and later]

The result when adding a watch on an object should resemble this:

[$boost_mixin/vs_natvis.png]

To install this visualizer:

* Locate `boost_mixin.natvis` in your Boost.Mixin installation. It should be in
the `tools` subdirectory.
* To install for your user only, copy it to
`<Documents>\<Visual Studio Version>\Visualizers`. If the directory doesn't
exist, create it manually.
* To install for all users, copy it to
`%VSINSTALLDIR%\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers`. You will need
administrator access to do this.

[endsect]

[section:autoexp Classic: autoexp.dat. VS 2003 and later]

The result when adding a watch on an object should resemble this:

[$boost_mixin/vs_autoexp.png]

To install this visualizer:

* Locate `autoexp.txt` in your Boost.Mixin installation. It should be in the
`tools` subdirectory.
* Open it in a text editor
* Open `%VSINSTALLDIR%\Common7\Packages\Debugger\autoexp.dat` in a text editor
* Typically it will end with a `[hresult]` section.
* Paste the entire content of `autoexp.txt` /just before/ the line `[hresult]`

To use this visualizer with Visual Studio versions 2012 or newer, you should
also go to in your menus to `Tools > Options > Debugging > Edit and Continue`
and there check `Enable native Edit and Continue`. Warning: This will also
disable any natvis visualizers you might have installed.

[section:mixin Watching a mixin]

No matter which (if any) of these visualizers you use, to watch concrete mixin
from an object, you should add a new watch where you explicitly cast the address
to the correct mixin type. The visualizers only help you quickly find the
address and the target type. They don't (and unfortunately can't) perform the
cast.

If you perform the cast correctly, the result will resemble this:
